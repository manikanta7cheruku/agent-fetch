# scheduler/jobs.py
"""
Phase 2 placeholder: scheduling / background jobs.

In the future, this module will:
- Use something like APScheduler or Celery
- Run tasks like:
  - Every day at 8 AM: fetch weather + crypto and summarize.
  - Every 10 min: check BTC price and send alerts if thresholds are hit.
